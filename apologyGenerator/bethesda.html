                        As a development studio, taken a lot ofjourneys. We've tried not to repeat ourselves, yet all our
games have a similar DNA. In 2015, we decided to try something very new, and very scary for us - take
one of our worlds and make it online only. Once the idea of Fallout-Online-Survival-Game' stuck, there
was no turning back, but still some worry and questions. "Will people want this from Fallout? Will they
want it from us? How the hell are we going to make this? And what, exactly is this?"
                    </br>
                </br>
Since that time, we've grown to four studios across North America and built a game world four times
the size of our last. We developed all new technologies and services - while bending older technology
to do things we didn't think it could. We pushed ourselves in new ways that surprised even us.
            </br>
        </br>
Our worlds, whether it be Fallout, Elder Scrolls, or the coming Starfield, are important places to us. We
do everything we can to treat them with care. We know they mean just as much to you. That the time
you spend in them is important, and you want each time you experience one to be special and all it can
be. And that with Fallout 76, you too are left wondering "What, exactly, is this?"
    </br>
</br>
And the answer to that question, more than any game we've made, is "that's up to you.
</br>
</br>
With our Beta starting tomorrow, it's finally time for Fallout 76 to begin its real journey. Because it's all
of you who will truly bring life to the world.
</br>
</br>
Usually after years of development, we finally finish, release the game, and take a break. With 76, we
feel we have not finished, but reached a starting line where all new work begins.
</br>
</br>
We all know with the scale of our games, and the systems we let you use, that unforeseen bugs and
issues always come up. Given what we're doing with 76, we know we're opening everyone up to all
new spectacular issues none of us have encountered. Some we're aware of, such as areas where
performance needs to improve with lots of players. Others, we surely don't. We need your help finding
them, and advice on what's important to fix. We'll address all of it, now and after launch.
</br>
</br>
We can't thank all of you enough for your support over the years, and your support while we try
something very new. It's incredibly exciting to finallyjump into the world of Fallout and experience it
together with you. This is just the start.
</br>
</br>
We can't wait to see you out there.
